# Cable Cutting Robot – Arduino & Python Control

This repository contains the Arduino and Python code for a semi-autonomous cable cutting mechanism developed for a Master's Thesis at EPFL.

- **Arduino code** handles gripping, lifting, and current-based contact detection.
- **Python script** lets you manually control the belt motors using keyboard inputs.

## How to Use

1. Upload the Arduino code ('Keyboard_controlled_belts.ino') to your Arduino Uno.
2. Run the Python script ('belt_control.py') to control the belt motors (W = up, S = down, ESC = exit).

Make sure the correct serial port is set in the script.
